postprocessing via:
bash batch.sh &> batch.log &

wait for those jobs to all finish, and then:
qsub enscat.sh

oaat_postp.py is the workhorse

I haven't figured out how to get dask workers in a batch context, so I am reading in files one at a time and concatenating them accordingly, with parallelization via the job scheduler.
