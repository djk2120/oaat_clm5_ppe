\section{Introduction}
\section{Experiment Description}
\subsection{Model description}
The Community Terrestrial System Model (CTSM) is developed by the CESM Land Model Working Group (LMWG) and maintained at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This experiment utilizes the Community Land Model configuration of CTSM, version 5.1 (CLM5.1). The model source code and documentation are available online (\url{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM}), as is a full model description \cite{lawrence2019}.

Relative to CLM5.0, version 5.1 includes minor bug fixes, several parameter adjustments, and the implementation of biomass heat storage \cite{swenson2019}. The PPE experiment required additional code modifications to identify and programmatically vary the full suite of model parameters. The exact model code for this experiment is contained in a development tag (\url{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/tree/branch_tags/PPE.n11_ctsm5.1.dev030}). We utilized the full biogeochemistry version of CLM in land-only mode, with the crop model turned off. The component set longname is: \\ \texttt{2000\_DATM\%GSWP3v1\_CLM51\%BGC\_SICE\_SOCN\_SROF\_SGLC\_SWAV\_SIAC\_SESP}

\subsection{Model spin-up}
Model spin-up for the equilibration of carbon and nitrogen pools within biogeochemistry-enabled land models can consume up to 98\% of computational time \cite{sun2023}.

%% Enter Figures and Tables near as possible to where they are first mentioned:

% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.

% Figure captions go below the figure.
% Acronyms used in figure captions will be spelled out in the final, published version.

% Table titles go above tables;  other caption information

% EXAMPLE FIGURES
%
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{example.png}
% \caption{caption}
% \end{figure}
%
% Giving latex a width will help it to scale the figure properly. A simple trick is to use \textwidth. Try this if large figures run off the side of the page.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{anothersample.png}
%\caption{caption}
%\label{pngfiguresample}
%\end{figure}
%
%
% If you get an error about an unknown bounding box, try specifying the width and height of the figure with the natwidth and natheight options. This is common when trying to add a PDF figure without pdflatex.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[natwidth=800px,natheight=600px]{samplefigure.pdf}
%\caption{caption}
%\label{pdffiguresample}

%
%
% PDFLatex does not seem to be able to process EPS figures. You may want to try the epstopdf package.

%  SECTION HEADS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for
% prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
% three or fewer letters).

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head
%
% Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
% type the appropriate head wording between the curly
% brackets, as shown below.

%An example:

% Level 2 head
%
% Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.

%  IN-TEXT LISTS

% Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
