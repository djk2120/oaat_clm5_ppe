\section{Introduction}
\section{Experiment Description}
\label{methods}
\subsection{Model description}
\label{sect:md}
The Community Terrestrial System Model (CTSM) is developed by the CESM Land Model Working Group (LMWG) and maintained at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This experiment utilizes the Community Land Model configuration of CTSM, version 5.1 (CLM5.1). The model source code and documentation are available online (\url{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM}), as is a full model description \cite{lawrence2019}.

Relative to CLM5.0, version 5.1 includes minor bug fixes, several parameter adjustments, and the implementation of biomass heat storage \cite{swenson2019}. The PPE experiment required additional code modifications to identify and programmatically vary the full suite of model parameters. The exact model code for this experiment is contained in a development tag (\url{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/tree/branch_tags/PPE.n11_ctsm5.1.dev030}). We utilized the full biogeochemistry version of CLM in land-only mode, with the crop model turned off. The component set longname is: \\ \texttt{2000\_DATM\%GSWP3v1\_CLM51\%BGC\_SICE\_SOCN\_SROF\_SGLC\_SWAV\_SIAC\_SESP}

\subsection{Model spin-up}
Model spin-up for the equilibration of carbon and nitrogen pools within biogeochemistry-enabled land models can consume up to 98\% of computational time \cite{sun2023}. Depending on the evaluation criteria and model configuration, CLM5 requires between 800 and 2000 years (or more) to reach steady-state conditions \cite{lawrence2019}. Absent equilibrium, the drift towards steady state can obscure important model dynamics or features. For this reason, each member of the PPE requires independent spin-up.

To manage computational cost we leveraged the Matrix-CN spin-up mode recently implemented within CLM \cite{lu2020}. This new module leverages a linearized simplification of CLM's biogeochemistry to significantly reduce spin-up time. Our spin-up protocol featured 20 years in accelerated decomposition mode, followed by 80 years of Matrix-CN, followed by 40 years of `normal' mode, cycling over a ten-year forcing dataset. This was designed to achieve sufficiently equilibrated model states, while minimizing computational time. To reduce model cost, we did not require full equilibration of deep soil carbon (beyond 1 meter). Any inferences about deep soil carbon would therefore be subject to uncertainty due to spin-up concerns.

\subsection{Sparsegrid}
\label{sect:sg}
One of the largest controls on model cost is resolution. Most CLM simulations utilize nominal 1$^\circ$ resolution, which requires over 20,000 land grid cells. In order to manage computational cost, parameter perturbation experiments often use lower resolution, such as 4$^\circ$x5$^\circ$ \cite{dagon2020}. CLM does not require standard rectilinear grids, which allows for innovative techniques to reduce model resolution

Multivariate spatio-temporal clustering (MVSC) has been utilized to extract patterns of climatological significance from climate model output \cite{hoffman2005} and applied to design a representativeness-based sampling network \cite{hoffman2013}. Instead of lowering resolution by increasing grid spacing, we used MVSC to strategically remove redundant grid cells, leaving only 400 grid cells that efficiently sample important model dynamics. Our goal was to quantify parameter effects with sufficient accuracy, while minimizing computational cost.

We used k-means clustering to identify groups of grid cells with similar climatologies based on a 2$^\circ$ transient simulation (1850-2014) using the CLM-PPE codebase. Instead of running every grid cell from a given cluster, we only run one representative grid cell, whichever is located nearest the cluster centroid in climate space. We refer to the set of representative grid cells as the `sparsegrid'. A paint-by-number approach is used to recompose mapped output and compute global means, where the output from the representative grid cell is substituted for all members of the cluster cohort.

Clustering was based on a subset of 18 meaningful CLM variables (Table \ref{tab:sg}). The clustering algorithm received 12 observations of each variable per grid cell, namely the mean and interannual variability computed for six 30-year climatology windows (1865-1894, 1895-1924, ... , 1985-2014). Clusters were delineated to equalize the multi-dimensional variance across the user-specified number of groups, $k$. We tested 15 values of $k$, ranging from 10 to 800. Based on ILAMB2.5 benchmarking \cite{collier2018} against the full grid output, we opted for a 400-cluster sparsegrid, to balance computational cost against model fidelity (Supp Figure \ref{supp:ilamb}). Because our emphasis is on vegetated regions, we masked out Antarctica within the clustering algorithm, whereby we do not provide any output below 60$^\circ$S.
